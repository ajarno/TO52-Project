## Opening an issue
### Adding a new feature or changing an existing one

* Talk to the other members about your project
* Open an issue. Describe your intention as clearly as possible, what are the objectives and what you want to achieve.

### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitLab under [Issues](https://github.com/ajarno/TO52-Project/issues).

* **Do not open up an issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**, and refer to our [Snyk](https://app.snyk.io/org/utannonces/).

> Snyk is a developer-first security solution that helps you use open-source code and stay secure. Snyk continuously finds and fixes known vulnerabilities on JavaScript npm dependencies. It offers tools to detect known vulnerabilities, and it also helps to fix these issues using guided upgrades and open-source patches that Snyk creates.

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, clearly describe the **steps necessary to reproduce the issue** you are running into and **screenshot** pr a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring. Then, it is time to [create a new branch](#working-on-a-branch).


## Working on a branch

_After opening an issue_
- Go to your project
- Pull, create and checkout on your local branch 
- Code
- Add, commit, push...
- Create Merge request
- Link the issue to the Merge request
- Ready for Merge request, remember to check the checkbox to delete the source branch after merge.

## Coding rules

### Coding conventions
We optimize for readability:
- We use linters extension: **ESLint** for all our javascript
- We use code formatter extension: **Prettier** 
- We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
- We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows
- We write comment to be understood quickly when code or methods need docs or are complicated

### Commit message guidelines

Consider starting the commit message with the **type of the commit** then add a clear and brief **description** of what you did.
`git commit -m "type: Add a description"`

#### Type of the commit
Must be one of the following:
* `build`: when that affect the build system or external dependencies (npm, makeâ€¦)
* `ci`: when concerning the integration and configuration files and scripts (Travis, Ansible, BrowserStack ...)
* `feat`: when introduing new features
* `fix`: when fixing a bug
* `perf`: when improving performance
* `refactor`: when refactoring code
* `style`: when improving structure / format of the code, changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* `docs`: when writing or updating documentation
* `test`: when adding or modifying tests

#### Description
The subject contains succinct description of the change:
* use present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end
